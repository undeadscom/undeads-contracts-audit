## Opening an issue

You can [open an issue] to suggest a feature or report a minor bug. For serious bugs please do not open an issue, instead, contact the repository owner via email. 

Before opening an issue, be sure to search through the existing open and closed issues, and consider posting a comment in one of those instead.

## Submitting a pull request

If you would like to contribute code or documentation you may do so by forking the repository and submitting a pull request.

Any non-trivial code contribution must be first discussed with the maintainers in an issue. Only very minor changes are accepted without prior discussion.
